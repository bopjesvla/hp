Predicted price cannot be below 0, otherwise the RMSLE function will return a NaN value (an imaginary number),
because the log of a negative value does not exist. 

There are only 7 houses with a swimming pool area. This variable does not seem to influence the prices much.

Prices of the previous month may correlate with the current prices. If so, we can add them as an predictor.
